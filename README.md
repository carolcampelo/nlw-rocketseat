# Notes App - NLW Rocketseat

This project was conducted by Rocketseat  at NextLevelWeek event that took place from 02/05/2023 to 02/08/2023. During this period I was able to build the initial structure of the project in order to improve it over time.

It was built using ReactJS with Vite, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. You can find features such as adding notes with voice recording (support for pt-BR only) or writing, deleting notes and searching for notes by terms and it follows accessibility and responsiveness standards.
